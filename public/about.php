			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>Midway Abatement District started in 2007 as an interim Mosquito Abatement District (MAD) in response to the West Nile Virus outbreak of 2006.
			It covers all residents in Jefferson County not living within the boundaries of Roberts MAD or Jefferson County MAD (see boundary map). In
			2009, the interim district became permanent, eventually adopting the name Midway Abatement District. Since its inception, Midway has
			contracted Clarke Environmental to provide comprehensive mosquito control services for the county including surveillance, larval control, and
			nightly adult treatments.
