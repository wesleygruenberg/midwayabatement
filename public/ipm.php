			<h2>An Integrated Approach to Mosquito Control</h2>
			
			<p>Successful mosquito management requires intervening at some point during the mosquito’s life cycle before they bite and infect a
			human.The best approach to controlling mosquitoes takes advantage of every life stage of a mosquito to achieve control, using a
			unified approach referred to as integrated pest management (IPM).
			</p>
			
			<p>IPM is a sciencebased, commonsense approach for managing pests and vectors, such as mosquitoes. IPM uses a variety of pest
			management techniques that focus on pest prevention, pest reduction, and the elimination of conditions that lead to pest
			infestations. IPM programs also rely heavily on resident education and pest monitoring.A successful IPM strategy can use pesticides.
			</p>
			
			<p>IPM uses a combination of ways to control mosquito populations with decisions based on surveillance, such as keeping track or
			count of the numbers and types of mosquitoes in an area. Surveillance is a critical component to any successful IPM program
			because the results from the surveillance will help determine the appropriate response to an infestation. Extensive infestations, or
			those where disease is present, merit a different response than will lower levels of infestations.Both CDC and EPA recognize a
			legitimate and compelling need for the use of chemical interventions, under certain circumstances, to control adult mosquitoes. This
			is especially true during periods of mosquitoborne
			disease transmission or when source reduction and larval control have failed or
			are not feasible.
			</p>
			
			<p>A successful integrated mosquito control strategy includes several tactics to eliminate mosquitoes and their habitat. Four critical
			tactics include: </p>

			<h4>1. Remove Mosquito Habitats</h4>
			
			<p>An important part of mosquito control around homes is making sure that mosquitoes don't have a place to lay their eggs.
			Because mosquitoes need water for two stages of their life cycle, it's important to monitor standing water sources.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Get rid of standing water in rain gutters, old tires, buckets, plastic covers, toys or any other container where
				mosquitoes can breed. </li>
				<li>Empty and change the water in bird baths, fountains, wading pools, rain barrels and potted plant trays at least once a
				week to eliminate potential mosquito habitats. </li>
				<li>Drain temporary pools of water or fill with dirt. </li>
				<li>Keep swimming pool water treated and circulating. </li>
				<li>If flood irrigating, do not over water and make sure water does not stand for long during warm weather. Mosquito eggs
				can hatch and larva can develop to pupa and then adults in just a few days. </li>

			<h4>2. Use Structural Barriers</h4>

			<p>Because mosquitoes frequently bite indoors, using structural barriers is an important way to reduce the incidence of bites.
			Examples of structural barriers include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Install window and door screens if they are not already in place.</li>
				<li>Cover all gaps in walls, doors and windows to prevent mosquitoes from entering. </li>
				<li>Make sure window and door screens are "bug tight." </li>
				<li>Completely cover baby carriers and beds with netting. Nets can be especially important for protecting a sick person from
				getting more mosquito bites, which could transmit the disease to other people. </li>
			</ul>

			<h4>3. Control Mosquitoes at the Larval Stage</h4>
			<img id="dipper-cup-image" src="images/larvae_dipping.jpg" alt="larva in dipper cup">
			<p>The greatest impact on mosquito populations will occur when they are concentrated, immobile and accessible. This
			emphasis focuses on habitat management and controlling the immature stages (egg, larva, and pupa) before the
			mosquitoes emerge as adults. This approach maximizes the effectiveness of pesticide application and minimizes the use
			from widespread pesticide application. Larvicides target larvae in the breeding habitat before they can mature into adult
			mosquitoes and disperse. Larvicide treatment of breeding habitats helps reduce the adult mosquito population in nearby
			areas. </p>
			
			<p>Culex pipiens mosquitoes can use natural locations or habitats (for example tree holes and crevices in plants) and
			artificial containers with water to lay their eggs. They lay eggs during the day in water containing organic material (e.g.,
			decaying leaves, algae, etc.) in containers with wide openings. They prefer darkcolored
			containers located in the shade.
			Other sites where they may lay their eggs include: old tires, buckets, toys, potted plant trays and saucers, plastic covers
			and even places as small as bottle caps. </p>
			<img id="bp-image" src="images/backpack.jpg" alt="backpack larvicide application"/>

			<p>Egg and larva interventions are generally the most effective, least costly, way to control mosquitoes. However, these
			interventions are unlikely to be 100% effective, especially for mosquitoes like the Culex pipiens that breed in varied and
			scattered locations. In these cases, eliminating or treating all or even most standing water can be nearly impossible.
			Successful control efforts will need to supplement habitat removal with other means of control.Involvement of the
			community is essential to these interventions. Residents, neighbors, and landlords can all be proactive in eliminating
			standing water or alerting others to its presence to eliminate even the smallest sources of standing water. </p>
			<p>There are a number of EPAregistered active ingredients used in larvicides. Choosing which larvicide to use in a given
			area is best done by experts and will depend on a variety of factors, including potential human or environmental risk,
			cost, resistance, and ease of use. </p>

			<h4>4. Controlling Mosquitoes at the Adult Stage</h4>

			<p>Using an EPA registered
			pesticide is one of the fastest and best options to combat an outbreak of mosquitoborne
			disease
			being transmitted by adult mosquitoes. The pesticides registered for this use are known as adulticides. Adulticides are
			applied either using aerial applications by aircraft or on the ground by truckmounted
			sprayers. </p>
			<p>Aerial spraying techniques can treat large areas with only small amounts of pesticide and have been used safely for more
			than 50 years. These aerial sprays are been fully evaluated by EPA and don’t pose risks to people or the environment
			when used according to the directions on the label. Mosquito adulticides are applied as ultralow
			volume (ULV) sprays.
			ULV sprayers dispense extremely small droplets. The Duet insecticide, for example, uses 80 microns or less which means
			hundreds of thousands of droplets could fit inside something as small as one pea. The small droplet size makes the
			pesticide more effective, which means less pesticide is used to better protect people and the environment. </p>
			<p>Extensive scientific research has been conducted by academia, industry, and government agencies to identify appropriate
			droplet sizes for individual compounds. The equipment nozzles undergo rigorous testing before being sold to the mosquito
			controllers. ULV applications involve very small quantities of pesticide active ingredient in relation to the size of the area
			treated. </p>
			<p>There are a number of registered adulticides to choose from. Choosing which adulticide to use in a given area is a job best
			done by experts and will depend on a variety of factors such as the type of mosquito, whether the mosquitoes are resistant
			to particular types of pesticides, weather, etc. </p>
