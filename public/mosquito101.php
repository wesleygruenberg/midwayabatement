			Knowing the different stages of the mosquito's life will help you prevent mosquitoes
			around your home and also help you choose the right pesticides for your needs, if you
			decide to use them. All mosquito species go through four distinct stages during their life
			cycle:

				<li><a href="#mosquito-pupa-stage">Pupa</a> - "tumbler" does not feed. This is the stage just before the mosquito emerges as an adult</li>

			</ul>
			
			<p>The first three stages occur in water, but the adult is an active flying insect. Only the
			female mosquito bites and feeds on the blood of humans or other animals.
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>After she obtains a blood meal, the female mosquito lays the eggs directly on or
				near water, soil and at the base of some plants in places that may fill with water.
				The eggs can survive dry conditions for a few months. </li>
				<li>The eggs hatch in water and a mosquito larva or "wriggler" emerges. The length of
				time to hatch depends on water temperature, food and type of mosquito. </li>
				<li>The larva lives in the water, feeds and develops into the third stage of the life cycle
				called, a pupa or "tumbler." The pupa also lives in the water but no longer feeds. </li>
				<li>Finally, the mosquito emerges from the pupal case after two days to a week in the
				pupal stage. </li>

			<h4>Egg Stage</h4>
		
			<p>Many mosquitoes, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culex_pipiens">Culex pipiens</a>, lay their eggs on 
			the surface of fresh or stagnant water. 
			The water may be in tin cans, barrels, horse troughs, ornamental ponds, swimming pools, puddles, creeks, ditches, 
			catch basins or marshy areas. Mosquitoes prefer water sheltered from the wind by grass and weeds.</p>

			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culex">Culex mosquitoes</a> usually lay their eggs at night over a period of time sticking them 
			together to form a 
			raft of from 100 to 300 eggs. A raft of eggs looks like a speck of soot floating on the water and is about 1/4 
			inch long and 1/8 inch wide. A female mosquito may lay a raft of eggs every third night during its life span.</p>

			<p>Anopheles and many other mosquitoes lay their eggs singly on the water surface. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes">Aedes</a> 
			and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochlerotatus">Ochlerotatus</a>  mosquitoes 
			lay their eggs singly, usually on damp soil.  Aedes and Ochlerotatus eggs are more resistant to drying out (some 
			require complete drying out before the eggs will hatch) and hatch only when flooded with water (salt water high tides, 
			irrigated pastures, treeholes flooded by rains, flooded stream bottoms).  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles">Anopheles</a>, 
			Culex and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansonia">Mansonia</a> eggs are 
			susceptible to drying out during extended droughts.</p>

			<p>Tiny mosquito larvae (1st instar) emerge from the eggs within 24 - 48 hours almost in unison.</p>

			<img class="mosquito101-image" id="larva-image" src="http://infinitespider.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Culex_sp_larvae-mosquito-larvae-wiki.png" alt="Mosquito larva"/>
			
			<h4>Larval Stage</h4>
			
			<p>Mosquito larvae, commonly called "wigglers," live in water from 4 to 14 days depending on water temperature.</p>

			<p>Larvae of almost all species must come to the surface at frequent intervals to obtain oxygen through a breathing 
			tube called a siphon. Larvae of Coquillettidia and Mansonia possess modified siphons that allow them to pierce the stems 
			of emergent vegetation in water and draw their oxygen from the plant in this process.  Larvae are constantly feeding 
			since maturation requires a huge amount of energy and food. They hang with their heads down and the brushes by their 
			mouths filtering anything small enough to be eaten toward their mouths to nourish the growing larvae. They feed on 
			algae, plankton, fungi and bacteria and other microorganisms. They breath at the water surface with the breathing 
			tube up breaking the water surface tension. The larvae of a few mosquito species are cannibalistic, feeding on larvae 
			of other mosquitoes: Toxorhynchites and some Psorophora, the largest mosquitoes known, are predators of other mosquito 
			larvae sharing their habitat. Their larvae are much larger than other mosquito larvae.</p>

			<p>During growth, the larva molts (sheds its skin) four times. The stages between molts are called instars. At the 4th 
			instar, the usual larva reaches a length of almost 1/2 inch and toward the end of this instar ceases feeding. When the 
			4th instar larva molts, it becomes a pupa.</p>

			<h4>Pupa Stage</h4>
			<p>Mosquito pupae, commonly called "tumblers," live in water from 1 to 4 days, depending upon species and temperature.</p>
			<p>The pupa is lighter than water and therefore floats at the surface. It takes oxygen through two breathing tubes called 
			"trumpets." The pupa does not eat, but it is not an inactive stage. When disturbed, it dives in a jerking, tumbling motion 
			toward protection and then floats back to the surface.</p>
			<p>The metamorphosis of the mosquito into an adult is completed within the pupal case. The pupal case thus serves as a factory wherein 
			the mosquito makes an adult out of a larva. The adult mosquito splits the pupal case and emerges to the surface of the water where 
			it rests until its body dries and hardens</p>

			<img class="mosquito101-image" id="adult-mosquito-image" src="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/Mosquito/Resources/Images/cdc-asian-tiger-mosquito.jpg" alt="Adult mosquito taking blood meal"/>
			
			<h4>Adult Stage</h4>
			<p>After breaking free of the pupal skin, the adult will rest on the water's surface for a brief period of 
			time to allow its body and wings to dry and harden. Once this has occurred the adult mosquito can now fly. 
			There are over 2,500 different species of mosquitoes in the world and about 20 different species within Midway Abatement 
			District. Different species will have different characteristics and behaviors. This affects things like; active 
			time period (e.g., daytime or nighttime biters), how far they fly from their hatching source, what types of 
			animals they "prefer" to bite (Example; some prefer birds over mammals) and other factors.</p>
			
			<p>Only female mosquitoes require a blood meal and bite animals - warm or cold blooded - and birds. Stimuli 
			that influence biting (blood feeding) include a combination of carbon dioxide, temperature, moisture, smell, 
			color and movement. Male mosquitoes do not bite, but feed on the nectar of flowers or other suitable sugar source. 
			Acquiring a blood meal (protein) is essential for egg production, but mostly both male and female mosquitoes 
			are nectar feeders for their nutrition. Female Toxorhynchites actually can't obtain a bloodmeal and are restricted 
			to a nectar diet. Of those female mosquitoes capable of blood feeding, human blood meals are seldom first or second 
			choices. Horses, cattle, smaller mammals and/or birds are preferred.</p>

			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes">Aedes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochlerotatus">Ochlerotatus</a> 
			mosquitoes are painful and persistent biters. They search for a blood meal early in the 
			morning, at dusk (crepuscular feeders) and into the evening. Some are diurnal (daytime biters) especially on cloudy 
			days and in shaded areas. They usually do not enter dwellings, and they prefer to bite mammals like humans. Aedes and 
			Ochlerotatus mosquitoes are strong fliers and are known to fly many miles from their larval developments sites.</p>

			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culex">Culex</a> mosquitoes are painful and persistent biters also, but prefer 
			to attack at dusk and after dark. They readily 
			enter dwellings for blood meals. Domestic and wild birds usually are preferred over man, cows, and horses. Culex 
			nigripalpus is known to transmit St. Louis encephalitis to man in Florida. Culex mosquitoes are generally weak fliers 
			and do not move far from home, although they have been known to fly up to two miles, Culex usually live only a few 
			weeks during the warm summer months. Those females that emerge in late summer search for sheltered areas where they 
			"hibernate" until spring. Warm weather brings them out again in search of water on which to lay their eggs.</p>

			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culiseta">Culiseta</a> mosquitoes are moderately aggressive biters, attacking 
			in the evening hours or in the shade during the day. 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psorophora">Psorophora</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coquillettidia">Coquillettidia</a>
			and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansonia">Mansonia</a> mosquitoes are becoming more pestiferous as an ever-expanding human population 
			invades their natural habitats. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles">Anopheles</a> mosquitoes are persistent biters and are the only mosquitoes which transmit 
			malaria to man.</p>
