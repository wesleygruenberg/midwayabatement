				<h2>Welcome</h2>
				<p>
				Thank you for visiting the website for Midway Abatement, proudly performing mosquito abatement for much of Jefferson County. 
				Since 2007 we have been providing mosquito control services. The purpose of this site is to increase public knowledge about mosquitoes 
				and how we go about controlling them. If you can't find what you're looking for, please feel free to contact us.
				</p><p>The Midway Abatement District is committed to making the area more livable, safe and comfortable. The district, partnered with Clarke 
				Environmental Mosquito Management accomplishes this
				 by employeeing effective Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies. IPM is designed to utilize 
				 cost-effective control measures to reduce mosquito populations and the diseases they 
				 potentially carry, while being environmentally sensitive.
				</p>
				<p>
				Communication and cooperation with property owners, residents and governmental agencies 
				are critical components in the effort to reduce mosquito populations. Midway Abatement  
				strives to be open and responsive to our community.
